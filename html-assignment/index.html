    <p>My name is Jade Menson and I'm 19 years old. My birthday is in April. I come from Ghana, where I live with my mum, dad and two brothers. <em>I currently go to school in Ottawa, Canada at Algonquin College.</em> I'm in the Interactive Media Design program. I moved here on the 6<sup>th</sup> September of 2022.</p>
    <p>I am doing <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> because since I was a kid, I've always loved everything about art and my guidance counselor recommended this program for me. So, I researched further and realized it was something I was interested in. I especially liked the photography, digital graphics and web development course. I love the practicality of these courses.</p>
